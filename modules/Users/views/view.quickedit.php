 *
 * This class is a view extension of the include/MVC/View/views/view.edit.php file.  We are overriding the ViewQuickEdit class because the
 * Users module quick edit treatment has some specialized behavior during the save operation.  In particular, if the user's status is set to
 * Inactive, this needs to trigger a dialog to reassign records.  The quick edit functionality was introduced into the Users module in the 6.4 release.
